# Cozy Vibes EShop

Welcome to **Cozy Vibes EShop** – a fictional online store inspired by Scandinavian design, offering a selection of candles, candle holders, vases, pots, blankets, and other home décor items to create a warm, cozy ambiance. 

This project was created as part of a school assignment to showcase my web development skills. While **Cozy Vibes EShop** is fictional, the product offerings are inspired by brands like Lagerhaus, which I am using as a reference for design and aesthetic. The goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to build a functional e-commerce site using modern technologies and best practices.

### Please note: 
This is a **fictional project** and is not intended for actual commercial use. All products and assets are based on inspiration from the Lagerhaus brand and are used solely for educational purposes.

## Features

- **Responsive design**: Fully responsive, ensuring the site looks great on all devices, from mobile to desktop.
- **Product catalog**: Browse categories like candles, vases, blankets, and other cozy home décor items.
- **Shopping cart**: Add, update, and remove products easily.
- **Admin dashboard**: Manage orders, products, and customers via an admin panel.
- **Search bar**: Search for products with help from the Google API. If the item is in the shop, it shows up normally. If not, it appears grayed out so you can still spot it.


## Features that still need to be implemented
- **Checkout process**: Streamlined checkout flow with form validation and Stripe payment integration.
- **Secure payment system**: Integrated with Stripe for safe and easy transactions.
- **Authentication**: User authentication and Admin authentication.

  The Stripe implementation with webhook broke when deploying the build, I'll come back to fix it at a later point. 

### Acknowledging the Original Theme:
- This project was initially themed after **Disco Elysium**-inspired products (clothing and accessories). However, the theme has since been updated to focus on **cozy home décor**, with inspiration drawn from real-life brands like **Lagerhaus** (used for educational purposes). This change reflects the more professional direction for the project, which is intended to showcase my skills in e-commerce development.
